## **DemoQA Automated UI Testing (Work in Progress)**

**Introduction:**
Welcome to the "demoqa-automated-ui-testing-wip" repository, an ongoing project dedicated to automating tests for the DemoQA website.  This project is a work in progress, focusing on implementing robust test cases using Java and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

**Project Structure:**
- Packages: Each category on the DemoQA website corresponds to a separate package.
- Classes: Within each package, individual subcategories are represented as classes, promoting a modular and organized structure.
- BasePage and BaseTest: Utilizing the POM design pattern, the project includes a BasePage class emphasizing abstraction for enhanced code reusability. The BaseTest class serves as a foundation for test classes.
- The utility package provides essential class  and helper methods, contributing to the efficiency and maintainability of the test automation suite.
  

**Noteworthy Features:**
- @FindBy and PageFactory: Leveraging annotations such as @FindBy and the PageFactory class for efficient element location strategies.
- Abstraction: The BasePage class is designed as an abstract template for derived page classes, promoting inheritance and consistent behavior.
- Structured Testing: Test classes are organized based on functionality, such as elements, forms, interactions, widgets, etc.
  

**Dependencies**
The project uses the following dependencies:
 - TestNG
 - Selenium WebDriver
 - Allure
